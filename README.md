# Data Science Intern  

## What's it all about?
The main question for the following research was the connection between social media usage and mental diseases all around the world. The idea was to connect the data from different sources and to find the correlation during the research. The hypothesis of this project was based on the assumption that the increase of socialmedia usage could increase mental disorders. Since there are a variety of mental disorders, it was decided to work mainly with three of those: ADHD, depression and anxiety. During the project we made the decision to split up the task into two parts so that the results could either be proved or denied in various ways based on different data sets. The results of this project are based on two different approaches. The first approach [first approach](https://github.com/republic-eclipse/Data-Science-Intern/blob/main/First%20Approach.R) is based on the key variable “age” with which we compare the data sets. The [second approach](https://github.com/republic-eclipse/Data-Science-Intern/blob/main/Second%20Approach.R) is based on the comparison of the World Happiness Index. This index playsa vital role since it is being used to create different country-pairs so that we were ableto pair the countries in a rational way.

## Requirements

If you want to use our scripts to create the plots for the approaches, make sure you have the following dependencies installed.

### Tidyverse
tidyverse is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures.

Install the complete tidyverse with:

```
install.packages("tidyverse")
```
### ggplot2
ggplot2 is a system for declaratively creating graphics, based on The Grammar of Graphics. You provide the data, tell ggplot2 how to map variables to aesthetics, what graphical primitives to use, and it takes care of the details.

Install ggplot with:
```
install.packages("ggplot2")
```
## Usage

Make sure to select the dataset folder as your working directory.
