# Data Science Intern  

The main question for the following research was the connection between social mediausage and mental diseases all around the world. The idea was to connect the data fromdifferent sources and to find the correlation during the research.The hypothesis of this project was based on the assumption that the increase of socialmedia  usage  could  increase  mental  disorders.   Since  there  are  a  variety  of  mentaldisorders, it was decided to work mainly with three of those:  ADHD, depression andanxiety.During the project we made the decision to split up the task into two parts so that theresults could either be proved or denied in various ways based on different data sets.The results of this project are based on two different approaches.  The first approachis based on the key variable “age” with which we compare the data sets.  The secondapproach is based on the comparison of the World Happiness Index. This index playsa vital role since it is being used to create different country-pairs so that we were ableto pair the countries in a rational way
